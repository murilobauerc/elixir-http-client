# To-do App

## A todo app created used as POC for usage of different flavors of http's client: HTTPoison, HTTPotion and Tesla

- [HTTPoison](https://github.com/edgurgel/httpoison) - the most popular HTTP client on hex.pm, powered by hackney
- [HTTPotion](https://github.com/unrelentingtech/httpotion) - powered by ibrowse
- [Tesla](https://github.com/teamon/tesla) - The flexible HTTP client library for Elixir, with support for middleware and multiple adapters.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `http_client` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:http_client, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/http_client](https://hexdocs.pm/http_client).
